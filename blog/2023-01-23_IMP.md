Canada's International Mobility Program is a great opportunity for foreign workers who want to move to Canada [1]. The program allows employers to hire workers on a Canada work permit without a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). This makes the process easier and more accessible for those looking to immigrate to Canada.

Under the International Mobility Program [1][2], employers are allowed to hire foreign workers in certain occupations without needing to submit a regular work permit application or a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). This makes the immigration process easier [1][2], faster, and more efficient for those looking to move to Canada.

The program is open to a wide range of occupations, including engineering, IT, business, finance, healthcare, and more. In addition, it is open to both temporary and permanent immigration. This allows employers to hire foreign workers for both short and long-term projects.

The program also has a few benefits for foreign workers. For example, it allows workers to apply for permanent residency after working in Canada for a certain period of time. This allows them to stay in Canada for longer, and possibly even become a Canadian citizen. Overall, Canada's International Mobility Program is a great way for employers to hire foreign workers and for those looking to immigrate to Canada to find work.
